            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            I built this website to impress you, I'll admit it, but now that I have your attention let me
            tell you a little bit about me.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm 25 years old & I live in RÃ¸dovre with my girlfriend.
            I'm passionate about more than most, space, music, sports, development, books.
            Anything that can keep my mind wandering will mostly like get my attention, which is probably why I love development.
            My mind is where I can explore ideas, plan project, problem-solve.. the code is simply my toolkit.
            Other than really loving to code, I enjoy making music, in fact, I write, compose and sing my own music.

            I'm still young and will literally always be learning, and I can't wait to see what my future holds!
